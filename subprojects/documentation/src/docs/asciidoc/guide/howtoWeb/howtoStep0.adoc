*Setup and start of a basic web view*

Let's start with the setup.

Please make sure you have visited the link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart[DolphinJumpStart] project
and have looked at the readme.

You can either choose to clone the repo for following each step (recommended)
or use the provided zip files for a Maven or Gradle build of your own application.

The root directory contains a maven pom.xml that you may want to import into your IDE for creating a project.
All major IDEs support projects based on maven pom files.

In case you are not using an IDE, follow the readme for how to build and run the various steps.

We start our development in html page step0.html view
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server-app/src/main/webapp/step0.html[step0.JumpStart]

It should appear on your screen like:

The code creates the basic app skeleton with dolphin client set up, creates client presentation model with one attribute and bind the value.

Note that we do _not_ define a "JumpStartPresentationModel" since presentation models in OpenDolphin
are totally generic.


Here is how the code looks like:

[source,html]
----
var PM_PERSON = "modelId"
var ATT_FIRSTNAME = "attrId"

var dolphin = opendolphin.dolphin(null, false); // <1>

var instantUpdateAttributePM = dolphin.attribute(ATT_FIRSTNAME, null, "Initial Value"); // <2>
dolphin.presentationModel(PM_PERSON, undefined, instantUpdateAttributePM); <3>

var instantUpdateHtmlInput = document.getElementById("instant-update-input"); // <4>

instantUpdateHtmlInput.oninput = function (event) { // <5>
    instantUpdateAttributePM.setValue(instantUpdateHtmlInput.value);
};

instantUpdateAttributePM.onValueChange(function (event) { // <6>
    instantUpdateHtmlInput.value = event.newValue;
});
----
<1> set up the dolphin
<2> make dolphin attribute to do the double binding with
<3> make client PM and add the attribute
<4> get html element to bind against the opendolphin attribute
<5> bind input of textfield to attribute (client change)
<6> bind other direction as well (e.g. for rebase(reset on client side) or server-side change)
