we make use of the bindable dirty state.

As soon as we change the content of the text field, a checkbox will become selected (checked).
If we remove our edits, it should become unselected (unchecked) again!

It should appear on your screen like:

Here is how the code to bind looks like:

[source,html]
----
var dirtyStatusHtmlElement = document.getElementById("dirty-status"); // <1>

instantUpdateAttributePM.onDirty(function (event) { // <2>
    dirtyStatusHtmlElement.checked = event.newValue;
});
----
<1> get html element to bind dirty of dolphin attribute
<2> bind dirty of dolphin attribute to html element value (when server change)

At this point we see the next benefit of presentation model and attribute abstractions:
they can provide more information about themselves and can carry additional state that is
automatically updated and available for binding.

Each attribute has a "base" value. When the current value differs from that base value, it is
considered "dirty". A presentation model is dirty, if and only if any of its attributes are dirty.

With this knowledge, we can even do a little more.
