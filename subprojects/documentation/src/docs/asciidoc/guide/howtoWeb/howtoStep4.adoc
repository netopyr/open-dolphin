We can now finally distribute the application as a true client-server application without any of the application
code being touched at all.
Only the server adapter needs to be in place and the client needs to connect to the correct URL.

As we are reusing the same servlet as for JavaFx example
the link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server/src/main/java/step_7/servlet/TutorialServlet.java[server adapter]
is a plain-old Servlet such that the code can run in any servlet container and registers actions with the server dolphin.

[source,java]
----
public class TutorialServlet extends DolphinServlet{
    @Override
    protected void registerApplicationActions(ServerDolphin serverDolphin) {
        serverDolphin.register(new TutorialDirector());
    }
}
----

The link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server/src/main/java/step_7/TutorialDirector.java[Tutorial director]
dolphin server action registers the available actions

[source,java]
----
public void registerIn(ActionRegistry registry) {
    getServerDolphin().register(new TutorialAction(logService)); // <1>
}
----
<1> register all your actions here.

The link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server/src/main/java/step_7/TutorialAction.java[Tutorial action]
defines the command handler for the action id "CMD_LOG"

[source,java]
----
public void registerIn(ActionRegistry actionRegistry) {
       actionRegistry.register(CMD_LOG, new CommandHandler<Command>() {
          public void handleCommand(Command command, List<Command> response) {
            service.log(getServerDolphin().getAt(PM_PERSON).getAt(ATT_FIRSTNAME).getValue());
          }
       });
}
----

As with any servlet, you need to register it in the
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server-app/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[web.xml] :

[source,xml]
----
<servlet>
    <display-name>TutorialServlet</display-name>
    <servlet-name>tutorial</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>step_7.servlet.TutorialServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>tutorial</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/tutorial/</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>
----

It should appear on your screen like:

image::./img/dolphin_pics/OpenDolphin-HowTo-Web-step4.png[width=500,height=500]

Code is in link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server-app/src/main/webapp/step4.html[step4.JumpStart]

Here is how the code to connect to server has to be:

[source,html]
----
var PM_PERSON = "step_7.TutorialConstants.modelId";
var ATT_FIRSTNAME = "attrId";

var SERVER_URL = "http://localhost:8080/myFirstDolphin/tutorial/"; // <1>
----
<1> Set server connection

Here is the code to send save command to server

[source,html]
----
instantUpdateAttributePM.onDirty(function (event) { // <1>
    saveButton.disabled = !event.newValue;
});

saveButton.onclick = function () { // <2>
    dolphin.send(CMD_LOG, {
       onFinished: function (models) {
        instantUpdateAttributePM.rebase();
      }
    });
};
----
<1> Bind dirty of dolphin attribute to enable save button
<2> Send request value changed to server

*That is it!*

We can now start the provided jetty server

[source]
----
./gradlew :server-app:jettyRun
----

Now when you access step4 and you click save button you should see the attribute value print.

*Final considerations*

This has been a very small application to start with but we have touched all relevant bases from
starting with a standalone view and up to a remote client-server setup.

You can bind individual HTML elements to attributes and vice versa like in the example above.
But just like for desktop clients, you can also use the model store listener to update
collections, use the dolphin instance to send individual commands, and even use the push listening.

In case that you are using any additional web technology like Angular.js or GWT
you can happily use the view generation and binding facilities of these technologies.
Simply use OpenDolphin attributes as the binding sources or targets.

*Remember: OpenDolphin is a library, not a framework.*

*We don't lock you in, we are open.*

Of course, a full application has more use cases than managing a single text field.

You will find more information about how to use the OpenDolphin.js features in the
<<Use Cases and Demos>> and in the live demos that are available on the
link:https://klondike.canoo.com/dolphin-grails/[live OpenDolphin.js demos] server.
They show the combination of various features and technologies with cross-linking to all sources.
