The OpenDolphin architecture supports the sharing of applications across
many devices. The previous chapter covered the usage of OpenDolphin for
Java Desktop clients: JavaFX, Swing, and others.

This chapter introduces the JavaScript client for OpenDolphin - commonly known as OpenDolphin.js -
that allows to use OpenDolphin on any web page.

Using OpenDolphin.js follows the exact same pattern as for Desktop clients:

* create the view (HTML)
* do the binding (JavaScript)

All the rest happens on the server.

It is a *full* implementation of the OpenDolphin architecture such that you profit from the full range
of features exactly like for the desktop clients and sharing the *identical* server-side application logic.

OpenDolphin.js does not depend on any other library (with the exception of require.js) and can thus be used
in combination
with any other web technology: plain HTML5, jQuery, Angular.js, GWT, vanilla.js, and whatever else you fancy.
The library itself was implemented with the help of TypeScript and additionally provides a full
TypeScript API for those who prefer to build their web application with that technology.

If you jumped directly to this chapter, for an easy entry into OpenDolphin, we will follow the steps described in section "Web example" of the
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart[DolphinJumpStart] project.

We implement a very simple application that contains only one text field and two buttons to 'save' or 'reset' the value.
'Saving' will do nothing but printing the current field value on the server side.

Both buttons are only enabled if there is really something to save/reset, i.e. the field value is dirty.
The dirty state is also visualized via disable buttons. Resetting set the last known attribute base value.
