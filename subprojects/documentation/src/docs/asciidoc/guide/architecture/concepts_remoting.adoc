A dolphin application has a client and a server module.
As we will see in <<Remote setup,remote config>> and <<Standalone in-memory usage,standalone config>>
this does not necessarily mean that client and server live in different VMs, but they can.

With OpenDolphin, the client is responsible to visualize presentation models,
the server is responsible to manage the presentation model data.

In order to keep client and server <<Collections of presentation models and the model store>> consistent,
one must be chosen as the master and the dolphin team has chosen the client to be that master.

All changes *first* happen *on the client*. Then the server is notified, and he updates automatically.

Any server-side changes happen by the server sending a <<Communicating via Commands>> to the client
instructing him which change to apply.

All communication between client and server happens *asynchronously* no matter whether an in-memory or
remote configuration is used.

Despite the asynchronous communication, OpenDolphin guarantees notification delivery in the same
sequence as they originated.

OpenDolphin assumes the client to have an event model and the server to live in a request-response model.
OpenDolphin bridges these two worlds.

Despite the asynchronous communication between client (view) and server (controller), all
processing that takes place as a result of this communication is automatically executed inside the client's
UI thread.
Especially all changes to the client model store, client presentation models, and attributes are subject to
this thread-confined approach. Thus, all binding events will be fired in the UI thread and the
views are automatically updated correctly.

Likewise, on the server (controller) side all actions are executed in a thread-confined manner, i.e.
there is at most one action at a time being executed and per roundtrip all actions are executed in the
same thread.

With the clear structure and division of responsibilities that OpenDolphin imposes onto the application
a lot of otherwise common headaches around proper thread handling disappear.
