_Binding_ is just another word for an event listener listening to an event source.

OpenDolphin supports binding between attributes and arbitrary other objects where
most of the time, these other objects are views - with the notable exception of
the dolphin infrastructure itself, which automatically listens for value changes
in order to notify the server.

While OpenDolphin is independent on any specific UI toolkit and works out-of-the-box
with every technology that understands PropertyChangeListeners (i.e. SWT and
Eclipse RCP), it provides special binding facilities for

* JavaFx and
* Swing

Bindings can work in both directions such that a view automatically
reflects any change in an attribute value or such that an attribute value is
automatically updated with every user input to a UI component.

An important design goal of OpenDolphin is to keep bindings stable.

For the typical use cases it should not be necessary to "unbind" or "rebind", not even
for use cases where a selection changes the to-be-displayed information, commonly
known as master-detail views.

Master-detail views come in many flavors:

* a list or table row selection with an associated detail view (often forms) for the row info
* a map or chart item selection with details per selected item
* a tabbed pane with the individual details (often forms) per tab

OpenDolphin allows to bind the detail view against a stable _placeholder_
presentation model that is automatically synchronized (both read and write)
with the selection.

WARNING: The detail view *never* has to change its binding!

In fact, this feature goes beyond master-detail views and applies to all
referential structures, which otherwise are a very difficult to handle
consistently in a user interface.
