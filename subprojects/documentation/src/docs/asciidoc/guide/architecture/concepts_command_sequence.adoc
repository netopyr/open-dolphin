We have seen that OpenDolphin uses commands for the communication between
views and controllers, that commands are sent in strict sequence even though they
are executed asynchronously, and that commands may have an *onFinishedHandler*
attached to it.

It goes without saying that any onFinished handler is only executed after the
controller action is finished. Therefore the name.

But despite the sequence guarantees that OpenDolphin gives you, there are
a few things to consider about the asynchronous programming model where it is
inherently different from procedural, UI-blocking code.

Let us first have a look at a typical chain of events.

*The sequence of independent commands*

The figure below depicts the chain of events that happens when three independent commands A, B, and C
are sent in immediate sequence. Time goes from top to bottom and the three columns represent three concurrent
processing units: the command queue, the controller actions (can even be remote), and the onFinished activity after the
action returned.

*1)* A, B, and C sit in the command queue (column 1).

*2)* A is removed from the queue and its actions are processed outside the UI thread, maybe even remotely on the server
(column 2). B and C remain in the queue (column 1).

*3)* All A actions are finished and the onFinished handler is called (column 3).
_While A.onFinished is executed inside the UI thread_ B was removed from the queue and the B actions are
processed concurrently outside the UI thread (column 2).

The execution of A.onFinished often triggers further commands (A1 and A2) that are fed into the queue (column 1)
just like any other ordinary command.

WARNING: At this point the B actions are processed without the effects of A being visible.
*B must not depend on the effects of A!*

*4, 5, 6, 7)* Emptying out the command queue.

Let's summarize the behavior so far

* commands are always processed in the strict sequence in which they appear in the command queue
* the onFinished handler is always executed after the respective action is finished
* a command is only processed after the preceding one has finished its actions (but not necessarily its onFinished handlers)
* an onFinished handler is only executed after the preceding onFinished handler is finished

Wouldn't it all be simpler if we waited for A to completely finish including all actions that it may possibly spawn
before processing B like in procedural programming?
*No*. This would mean that we have to block the queue during that time, which in turn would block the UI -
and blocking the UI is the worst you can do.

"_But what if B depends on the effects of A_?" This is when we need the onFinishedHandler
as explained in the next section.

*When commands depend on previous ones*

Let's assume that A creates a presentation model and B changes a value in that model.
Then B depends on A and we have to make sure that at the time when the B action is processed all effects of A
are visible, i.e. the presentation model is available in the model store.

This is when we place the sending of the B command in the onFinished handler of the A command.
So instead of

[source]
clientDolphin.send "A"
clientDolphin.send "B"
clientDolphin.send "C"

we do

[source]
clientDolphin.send "A", {
    println "Hey, we are inside the onFinished handler!"
    clientDolphin.send "B"
}
clientDolphin.send "C"

The figure below shows the resulting command sequence:

image::./img/OpenDolphin-Command-Sequence-onFinished.png[]

Note row number *3*. Only in the course of A.onFinished being executed (column 3) is the B command added to the
command queue (column 1) and _guaranteed after_ A1 and A2, which notify the server of the created presentation model.
So all relevant state is properly updated when B's actions (*6*) and onFinished handler (*7*) are called.

*Practical considerations*

Asynchronous programming models all have in common that when some logic is dependent on some asynchronous task
there is a callback like the onFinished handler involved.

This leads to the question of what to do with a chain of dependencies. Does that automatically lead to
deeply nested callback structures that are difficult to write and understand? Not necessarily.

Various solution are on the market (i.e. "promises") but OpenDolphin has a simple way where we do not need to
understand another concept. We simply send an extra command.

This command doesn't need to do anything, only provide us with an onFinished handler such that we can add us
to the command queue at the appropriate time when all is ready.
You guessed it: such a command already exits. It is the EmptyCommand
and you can send it via the ClientDolphin's *sync* method.


So even if you have a dependency chain like A <- B <- C there is no need to write

[source]
clientDolphin.send "A", {
    clientDolphin.send "B", {
        clientDolphin.send "C"
    }
}

but you can issue the command in this context-free fashion:

[source]
clientDolphin.send "A"
clientDolphin.sync { clientDolphin.send "B" }
clientDolphin.sync { clientDolphin.send "C" }

Likewise, when B and C depend on A but not on each other (A <- B, A <- C) you can code this as

[source]
clientDolphin.send "A"
clientDolphin.sync {
    clientDolphin.send "B"
    clientDolphin.send "C"
}

The above has the additional effect that when B has finished, C will immediately follow
without any other command possibly sneeking in between the two,
no matter whether it originates from user input or preceding commands.
In that sense you can see the *sync* as enclosing an atomic operation.
