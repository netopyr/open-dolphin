All communication in OpenDolphin happens with the help of the Command Pattern.

* Notifications from the client to the server are sent as commands.
* Instructions from the server to the client are sent as commands.
* The client can request additional data (beyond presentation models) with the help of a *DataCommand*.

Commands are simple POJOs and there is a limited set of commands available for synchronization between
client and server.

On the application level only the following commands are used:

* NamedCommand is a generic command to trigger a server side action that was registered for this name
* DataCommand requests arbitrary data that is unrelated to presentation models
There is no need to implement any application specific command classes.

In remote scenarios, commands are encoded and decoded via a _codec_ (i.e. JSONCoDec).

A _transport_ (i.e. HttpTransport or InMemoryTransport) can be configured to use such a _codec_.

Commands are used as a unit of transport since they are simple to encode/decode but
also since they can be optimized in a number ways (buffering when the server is
temporarily unavailable, batching, elimination of duplicates) and they open the
opportunity for later inclusion of undo/redo capabilities.

Since commands are sent asynchronously, one cannot wait for a command to complete.
When sending a command, though, one can provide an *OnFinishedHandler* that is called back
as soon as the command has returned. The list of all presentation models that were affected by that
command is passed as argument into the callback methods.
