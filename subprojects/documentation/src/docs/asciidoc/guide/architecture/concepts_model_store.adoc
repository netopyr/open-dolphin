Any reasonably sized UI will have not only single presentation models but many of the same type.

Let's assume that the application displays a list of vehicles where each vehicle is a
presentation model instance of type "vehicle".

The list view must add a new row whenever a new vehicle becomes available and must
remove the row when the vehicle becomes unavailable.

To this end, the list view can register itself as a *ModelStoreListener* and will
be notified whenever a presentation model is added to or removed from the store.

The model store defines the managed object space for presentation models.

There are two such stores: one on the client and one on the server.
Both are automatically synchronized by OpenDolphin.

Conceptually, one can see the model store as

* a distributed, in-memory, no-sql database with only two tables (presentation model and attribute)
* a specialized event bus (event provider is only the store itself and only ModelStoreEvents are issued)

The application programmer should not access the model store directly
but only through the facade layer, see link:./../ref/dolphin/usage.html[Dolphin Usage].

The model store is used internally as a value change listener to all known attributes in order to

* consistently update all attributes of the same _qualifier_
* notify the server about changes

Now, let's have a look how the client-server split is designed in OpenDolphin.
