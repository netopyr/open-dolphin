Please have a look at this short video in a separate window: link:http://people.canoo.com/mittie/JavaFX_Navis_Dolphin.mp4[container yard demo]

You see a monitoring application that has been implemented in a joint effort by

* Navis
* Oracle
* Canoo
and was demonstrated at the JavaOne 2012 strategy keynote.

This application uses JavaFX on the client side and builds upon an existing server-side programming model.

OpenDolphin combines these two worlds.

The application was first developed in a purely 2-D fashion and later extended to 3-D.

Despite the rather dramatic effect that this extension had to the user interface, the presentation models
did not change by a single bit!

This example demonstrates:

* the value of having the full "fidelity" of a Java desktop client
* how to leverage the power of Java server-side applications
* how OpenDolphin helps to stay independent of changes in visualization and protects the investment in application logic
