For "point-of-sale" applications it is typical that you have fewer workstations than
people using them, for example:

* cash registers in a shop
* workstations in a restaurant
* desktop computers in a hospital

In such a setting, you may start your work at one workstation, service the customer,
return to the workstation only to find it occupied by a co-worker, and complete the
transaction at some other workstation that happens to be available.

You certainly want to take your working context with you!

OpenDolphin makes this possible by combining the strategies that we have seen for
<<Follow-me applications with re-connect,follow-me>> and <<Team applications for collaborative work,team>> applications.
