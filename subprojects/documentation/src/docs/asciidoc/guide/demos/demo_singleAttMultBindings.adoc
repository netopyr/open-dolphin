*Use Case*

Sometimes a value change in lets say a text field should immediately update all
dependent views (a label, a frame title) -
but sometimes only when a certain event occurs: button clicked, enter pressed, focus change and the likes.

Sometimes the binding is unidirectional, sometimes bidirectional.

*Approach*

OpenDolphin bindings are always immediate.
When the source value changes the target value is updated immediately.

If you need a deferred update, you do not use binding at all but provide the respective
event handler to copy the value from the source to the target, usually by setting the
value of an attribute.

Bindings are always unidirectional.
If you need bidirectional binding, you use two binding statements, one for either direction.

*Demo*

The demo looks like

When you edit the text field, the header is immediately updated.

Label and frame title are only updated when hitting enter in the text field or when clicking the button.

Please see the full link:https://github.com/canoo/open-dolphin/blob/master/subprojects/demo-javafx/client/src/main/groovy/org/opendolphin/demo/SingleAttributeMultipleBindingsView.groovy[demo sources].

OpenDolphin bindings always go from source to target.
This code makes sure that whenever the title attribute of the presentation model changes,
the title of the frame is updated:

[source,groovy]
----
bind TITLE of pm to FX.TITLE of primaryStage   // <1>
----
<1> groovy style

The same is true for the label, but here we are more Java-stylish:

[source,java]
----
bind(TITLE).of(pm).to(FX.TEXT).of(label) // <1>
----
<1> java fluent-interface style

The input text field shall always show the value of the title attribute:

[source,groovy]
bind TITLE of pm to FX.TEXT of input

Hitting enter or clicking the button shall copy the value of the text input field
to the attribute and thus trigger update of all bound views.
We share the same event handler for the onAction of the text input field and
the submit button:

[source, groovy]
def copyFieldToPm = { pm[TITLE].value = sgb.input.text } as EventHandler
sgb.input.onAction  = copyFieldToPm
sgb.submit.onAction = copyFieldToPm


_Corner case_:
If we need a mixture of both immediate and deferred update, then we have a bit of
a problem. We can resolve it by directly binding the views (ignoring the attribute):

[source,groovy]
----
bind FX.TEXT of input to FX.TEXT of header // <1>
----
<1> auto-update the header with every keystroke

The views now act as one "combined" view, but this situation should be avoided since
we do not want the views to know each other. They shall only know their attributes.

_Variant_:
A second way of approaching the above is binding the text field back to the title
attribute, which will automatically trigger updates of all dependent views with
every keystroke. This is effectively a bidirectional binding:

[source,groovy]
----
bind TEXT of input to TITLE of pm // <1>
----
<1> It is an alternative that updates the pm with every keystroke and thus all bound listeners
    bind TEXT of input to TITLE of pm
