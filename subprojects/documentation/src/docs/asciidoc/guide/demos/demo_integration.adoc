OpenDolphin applications can serve many different client technologies and keep them instantly up to date.
We have seen that for <<One application on multiple devices,many devices>> and <<Team applications for collaborative work,team>> applications.

These capabilities also allow to have clients that are made up from a combination of very different technologies
and tool kits, let's say Swing, JavaFX, SWT, and HTML5. Integrating those technologies on the client side
can be difficult because of different concurrency models and assumptions about the execution environment.
It is safer and more practical to keep them
totally independent on the client side - just like OpenDolphin is decoupling all its views.
The integration then happens technology-independent on the server side.

Multi-technology applications are sometimes needed to use the best of each world, e.g.

* JavaFX for general structure, interactivity, layout, effects, animation, and 3D
* Swing for self-made or acquired custom components
* HTML5 for great charts and other visualizations

They are also often seen in the transition phase when migrating smoothly from one UI technology to the next.

OpenDolphin allows to keep all the various parts "pluggable" and fully distinct while providing
an integrated up-to-date visualization.
