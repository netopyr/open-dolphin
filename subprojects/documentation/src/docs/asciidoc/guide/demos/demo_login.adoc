The login demo is a short intro that explains the general approach of OpenDolphin
without any code.

When watching the video, please pay attention to the following parts:

* first, an action is registered on the server side
* a presentation model is created on the client side with attributes for username, password, and loggedIn status
* the presentation model _automatically_ sent to the server
* the client creates a view for the login
* the view binds against the attributes
* when the user enters a name, this _automatically_ changes the attribute on _both_ client and server side
* the communication happens asynchronously; the user *does not have to wait* before entering the password
* in the very same manner, the password gets transferred
* the user clicks on the login button
* a command is sent to the server which triggers the login action
* this reads username and password and sets the loggedIn status to TRUE (*)
* the status change is automatically mirrored on the client
* the login view disappears since its visible property is bound against the not-loggedIn attribute

(*) technically, the server sends a ValueChangedCommand to the client but this is an implementation detail.
