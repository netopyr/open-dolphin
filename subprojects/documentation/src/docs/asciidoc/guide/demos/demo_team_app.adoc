While <<Follow-me applications with re-connect,follow-me>> applications provide the technical basis for a new kind of _personal_
working style, even whole teams can leverage this capability to achieve a _collaborative_ working style with
team applications of the next generation.

OpenDolphin allows that the whole team can work from many locations with many devices but still (optionally)
live sharing what everybody is doing in real-time. When you see what other team members are doing, it becomes
much easier to avoid conflicts and double work while at the same time one can correct errors, offer help and
get help from others.

Consider for example this scenario:

* You are in a customer meeting, closing a deal. You capture the initial contract data on your tablet.
* A back office worker recognizes what you are doing, completing and correcting the contract information _while you are at it_.
* With the contract being complete, you let the customer sign it on the tablet.

There are literally countless other scenarios:

* collaboratively editing a document (think Google Wave, Google Docs, or SubEthaEdit)
* sharing an app with your customer to instantly see the effect of various order sizes, discount rates, etc.
* sharing a stock ticker app where an expert selects "hot stocks" that the trader should pay attention to
* collaboratively managing a pool of resources where adding/removing of items can lead to buffer overruns or underruns that need to be re-balanced
* capturing meeting minutes by all participants together such that there is implicit agreement
* even a mere chat is a kind of team application.
An interactively shared application can very much enhance customer bonding, increase work efficiency, and foster team spirit.
