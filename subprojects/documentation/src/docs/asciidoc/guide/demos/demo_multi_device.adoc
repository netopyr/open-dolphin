Since version 0.9, OpenDolphin can display the same application on many different
devices at the same time, including personal computers, laptops, tablets, and smartphones.

One such example is https://klondike.canoo.com/dolphin-grails/demo/js/teammember/TeamMemberDetails.html[the team-members live demo]
that you can connect to

* from a JavaFX client
* through the browser
* from a tablet
* from a smartphone

The way to achieve this is to have

* one and only one application on the server side made from OpenDolphin actions
* various client-specific views, in this case JavaFX and JavaScript where the HTML5/JavaScript part can be natively packaged for mobile devices.

The multi-device capability of OpenDolphin is the basis for many other use cases:

* <<Follow-me applications with re-connect,follow-me applications>>
* <<Team applications for collaborative work,team applications>>
* <<Floating workstations in a point-of-sale solution,point-of-sale applications>>
* <<Integration of many technologies into one app,multi-technology integration>>
