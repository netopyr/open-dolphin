we first cleanup the code such that it becomes more obvious, which part belongs to the (client) view and the
(server) controller. In the first place, OpenDolphin leads to a _logical_ view-controller distinction and
client-server split. The only thing that is optionally shared are constants.

It is always a good idea to refactor literal values into constants, especially if they
are used in more than one place for a unique purpose.
Therefore, we will extract our String literals into static references:

[source,java]
private static final String MODEL_ID           = "modelId";
private static final String MODEL_ATTRIBUTE_ID = "attrId";
private static final String COMMAND_ID         = "LogOnServer";


The configuration setup now moves into the constructor:

[source,java]
public JumpStart() {
    config = new DefaultInMemoryConfig();
    textAttributeModel = config.getClientDolphin().presentationModel(MODEL_ID, new ClientAttribute(MODEL_ATTRIBUTE_ID, ""));
    config.getClientDolphin().getClientConnector().setUiThreadHandler(new JavaFXUiThreadHandler());
    config.registerDefaultActions();
}


This leaves the "start" method with "view" responsibilities only:
the initial contruction and separate method calls for binding and registering actions.

[source,java]

@Override
public void start(Stage stage) throws Exception {
    Pane root = PaneBuilder.create().children(
            VBoxBuilder.create().children(
                    textField = TextFieldBuilder.create().build(),
                    button    = ButtonBuilder.create().text("press me").build(),
                    HBoxBuilder.create().children(
                            LabelBuilder.create().text("IsDirty ?").build(),
                            status = CheckBoxBuilder.create().disable(true).build()
                    ).build()

            ).build()
    ).build();

    addServerSideAction();
    addClientSideAction();
    setupBinding();

    stage.setScene(new Scene(root, 300, 100));
    stage.show();
}

We add an additional labeled checkbox to visualize the status: whether the text field - or more precisely the dolphin attribute that backs it - is considered "dirty".

As soon as we change the content of the text field, this checkbox will become selected (checked).
If we remove our edits, it should become unselected (unchecked) again!

Here is how the binding for that requirement looks like:

[source,java]
JFXBinder.bind("text").of(textField).to(MODEL_ATTRIBUTE_ID).of(textAttributeModel);
JFXBinder.bindInfo("dirty").of(textAttributeModel.getAt(MODEL_ATTRIBUTE_ID)).to("selected").of(status);


At this point we see the next benefit of presentation model and attribute abstractions:
they can provide more information about themselves and can carry additional state that is
automatically updated and available for binding.

Each attribute has a "base" value. When the current value differs from that base value, it is
considered "dirty". A presentation model is dirty, if and only if any of its attributes are dirty.

With this knowledge, we can even do a little more.
