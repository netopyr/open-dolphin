We stay in the "combined" module and enhance the JavaFX view

just slightly with a TextField and a Button that prints the content of the TextField when clicked.

The application should appear on your screen like:

The code now contains references to the widgets
[source,java]
private TextField field;
private Button    button;


and an action handler

[source,java]
button.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    public void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
        System.out.println("text field contains: "+field.getText());
    }
});

The printing of the field content is our "stand-in" for a real business logic.
You can easily assume some persistence action at this point or
"service" calls in general.

Now it is time to introduce OpenDolphin.
