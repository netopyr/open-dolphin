We finish the application with some more refactorings in
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/client/src/main/java/step_6/TutorialApplication.java[step6.TutorialApplication]
and some tweaks to the view such that it appears like

image::./img/dolphin_pics/OpenDolphin-HowTo-step6.png[]

The true value of the change is not visible in a screenshot, though, since it is in the behavior.
The modified background color of the text field appears as soon as it becomes dirty and is
set back to the original state when the dirty state is set back.

To make this happen, we enhance the binding with a little trick in the converter that
adds the "dirty" style class to the text field when needed and removes it otherwise.

[source,java]
Converter converter = new Converter<Boolean,Boolean>() {
    public Boolean convert(Boolean dirty) {
        if (dirty) {
            textField.getStyleClass().add("dirty");
        } else {
            textField.getStyleClass().remove("dirty");
        }
        return null;
    }
};
JFXBinder.bindInfo("dirty").of(textAttributeModel).using(converter).to("style").of(textField);


The tutorial.css contains the definition of that style, which makes the code very flexible
should we later decide to visualize the dirty state differently.

[source,css]
----
.root {
    -fx-background-color: linear-gradient(to bottom, transparent 30%, rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.15) 100%);
}
#content {
    -fx-padding : 20;
    -fx-spacing : 10;
}
.dirty {
    -fx-background-color: papayawhip;
}

Once we have the view code so nicely refactored to be free of any other responsibility,
we can spend some extra brain cycles on improving the look and feel, both when
visualizing state but also for emphasizing state transitions.

*Reset by shaking the field*

When we click the "reset" button, the dirty value is replaced by the last known base value
and a "shake" animation is played on the text field.

A shake is a rotation of the field around its center by an angle from -3 to +3 degrees.
This is done 3 times during 100 ms each. It makes for a funny effect.

[source,java]
----
final Transition fadeIn = RotateTransitionBuilder.create().node(textField).toAngle(0).duration(Duration.millis(200)).build();
final Transition fadeOut = RotateTransitionBuilder.create().node(textField).fromAngle(-3).interpolator(Interpolator.LINEAR).
        toAngle(3).cycleCount(3).duration(Duration.millis(100)).
        onFinished(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
            @Override
            public void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
                textAttributeModel.getAt(ATT_FIRSTNAME).reset();
                fadeIn.playFromStart();
            }
        }).build();

reset.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    @Override
    public void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
        fadeOut.playFromStart();
    }
});
----

Note that the transition is only created once but played as often as you click the button.

*Yes, director!*

The server (controller) part has been divided in two classes: the
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server/src/main/java/step_6/TutorialAction.java[step6.TutorialAction]
that contains only one application-specific action and the
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server/src/main/java/step_6/TutorialDirector.java[step6.TutorialDirector]
who selects which actors should appear in the play, i.e. registers actions with the server dolphin.

This distinction makes it easier to evolve the application when new actions come into play since the
server adapter (servlet) doesn't have to change when the list of actions changes as we will see in a minute.
