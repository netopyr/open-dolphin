With the application being properly structured into its modules, we can now finally distribute it as a
true client-server application without any of the application code being touched at all.
Only the server adapter needs to be in place and the client starter needs to
connect to the correct URL.

The link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server/src/main/java/step_7/servlet/TutorialServlet.java[server adapter]
is a plain-old Servlet such that the code can run in any servlet container. It is as small as can be:

[source,java]
public class TutorialServlet extends DolphinServlet{
    @Override
    protected void registerApplicationActions(ServerDolphin serverDolphin) {
        serverDolphin.register(new TutorialDirector());
    }
}

As with any servlet, you need to register it in the
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server-app/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml[web.xml] :

[source,xml]
<servlet>
    <display-name>TutorialServlet</display-name>
    <servlet-name>tutorial</servlet-name>
    <servlet-class>step_7.servlet.TutorialServlet</servlet-class>
</servlet>

<servlet-mapping>
    <servlet-name>tutorial</servlet-name>
    <url-pattern>/tutorial/</url-pattern>
</servlet-mapping>

The
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/client/src/main/java/step_7/TutorialStarter.java[step7.TutorialStarter]
can now move to the "client" module since it is no longer dependent on the combination of client and server.
It can be cleaned from setting up the in-memory server and must of course point to the server URL:

[source,java,indent=0]
    public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
        ClientDolphin clientDolphin = new ClientDolphin();
        clientDolphin.setClientModelStore(new ClientModelStore(clientDolphin));
        HttpClientConnector connector = new HttpClientConnector(clientDolphin, "http://localhost:8080/myFirstDolphin/tutorial/");
        connector.setCodec(new JsonCodec());
        connector.setUiThreadHandler(new JavaFXUiThreadHandler());
        clientDolphin.setClientConnector(connector);
        TutorialApplication.clientDolphin = clientDolphin;
        Application.launch(TutorialApplication.class);
    }


*That is it!*

We can now start the provided jetty server

[source]
----
./gradlew :server-app:jettyRun
----
and then as many TutorialStarter clients as we want.

Alternatively, we can now create a WAR file via Maven or Gradle and deploy it on any server you fancy.

*Some extra flexibility*

You may have observed that we refactored the actual server-side printing into a service class with
a service interface. This allows some extra flexibility when the server-side action depends on any
technology that is only available on the server - say JEE, JPA, Spring, GORM, etc.

Refactoring the access into an interface allows us to still use the same code
with the in-memory mode for testing, debugging, profiling, and so on with a
stub or mock implementation for the service interface.

*Final considerations*

This has been a very small application to start with but we have touched all relevant bases from
starting with a standalone view, through proper modularization, up to a remote client-server setup.

We have used a "bare-bones" setup with 100% pure Java and a no dependencies beyond Java 7+
and OpenDolphin.

This is to show that OpenDolphin is as "un-opinionated" as can be.

In real life and in most of the demos that ship with OpenDolphin, we make additional use of
Groovy, GroovyFX, and Grails. Note that you can use any client- and server-side framework
and technology
with OpenDolphin: Griffon, Eclipse RCP, Netbeans - JEE, Spring, Grails, Glassfish, JBoss, Hibernate,
WebLogic, WebSphere, you name it.

*Remember: OpenDolphin is a library, not a framework.*

*We don't lock you in, we are open.*

Of course, a full application has more use cases than managing a single text field.

The <<Use Cases and Demos>> chapter leads you through the typical use cases of
master-detail views, form-based pages, collections of data, lazy loading, shared attributes,
CRUD operations, and much more by describing the use case, explaining the
OpenDolphin approach of solving it, and pointing to the respective demos.
