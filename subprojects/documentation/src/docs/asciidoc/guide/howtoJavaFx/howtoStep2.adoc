In step 2 we refactor the JavaFX application into
link:https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/combined/src/main/java/step_2/JumpStart.java[step2.JumpStart]
to make use of OpenDolphin.

The visual appearance and the behavior has not changed

image::./img/dolphin_pics/OpenDolphin-HowTo-step1.png[]

but the code has.

As an intermediate step, we have put the OpenDolphin setup and the usage in the same place.
Don't worry if this looks ugly. We will clean it up in a minute.

Focus on these lines in the code:

We create a presentation model with the distinctive name "input" and an attribute for the "text" property.

[source,java]
PresentationModel input = clientDolphin.presentationModel("input", new ClientAttribute("text"));

Note that we do _not_ define a "JumpStartPresentationModel" since presentation models in OpenDolphin
are totally generic.

Behind the scenes (no pun intended) happens quite a lot:

* the input presentation model is added to the client model store (with indexes being updated)
* the client dolphin registers itself as a property change listener to the value of the "text" attribute
* the server dolphin is asynchronously notified about the creation, which you can observe in the logs
* the server dolphin asynchronously updates its model store accordingly.

While this happens, we bind the text property of the TextField (this is a JavaFX property) to the "text" attribute of
the input presentation model

[source,java]
JFXBinder.bind("text").of(field).to("text").of(input);

Note the fluent API for setting up the binding.

[WARNING]
====
The above is plain Java. When we use Groovy, we can make use of Groovy's command chain syntax
that allows writing the *exact same code* as

[source,groovy]
bind "text" of field to "text" of input

====

Finally, the action handler that was part of the (client) view before now moves to the
(server) controller. We register it as an "action" on the server-dolphin.

[source,java]
config.getServerDolphin().action("PrintText", new NamedCommandHandler() {
    public void handleCommand(NamedCommand namedCommand, List<Command> commands) {
        Object text = serverDolphin.getAt("input").getAt("text").getValue();
        System.out.println("server text field contains: " + text);
    }
});


WARNING: Note that the (client) view and the (server) controller *do not share any objects!*

The dolphin server action must therefore ask the server-dolphin for the "text" value
of the "input" presentation model before he can print it.

Triggering the server action becomes the remaining statement in the button's onAction handler.

[source,java]
button.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    public void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
        clientDolphin.send("PrintText");
    }
});


When we now start the application we see in the log:

[source]
----
[INFO] C: transmitting Command: CreatePresentationModel pmId input pmType null attributes [[propertyName:text, id:761947653, qualifier:null, value:null, tag:VALUE]]
[INFO] S:     received Command: CreatePresentationModel pmId input pmType null attributes [[propertyName:text, id:761947653, qualifier:null, value:null, tag:VALUE]]
[INFO] C: transmitting Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, null ->
[INFO] S:     received Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, null ->
[INFO] C: server responded with 0 command(s): []
[INFO] C: server responded with
{code}
----

The C prefixes illustrate statements that are logged from the Client. S prefixes denote statements that are logged from the Server.

The log statements are telling us that the presentation model has been created and the value changed from null to an empty String,
the JavaFX default value for text fields.

Let's enter "abcd":

[source]
----
[INFO] C: transmitting Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653,  -> a
[INFO] S:     received Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653,  -> a
[INFO] C: server responded with 0 command(s): []
[INFO] C: transmitting Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, a -> ab
[INFO] S:     received Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, a -> ab
[INFO] C: server responded with 0 command(s): []
[INFO] C: transmitting Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, ab -> abc
[INFO] S:     received Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, ab -> abc

[INFO] C: transmitting Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, abc -> abcd
[INFO] S:     received Command: ValueChanged attr:761947653, abc -> abcd
[INFO] C: server responded with 0 command(s): []
----

Every single change is asynchronously sent to the server dolphin. Note that the user interface *does not block*.

Finally, we hit the button

[source]
----
[INFO] C: transmitting Command: PrintText
server text field contains: abcd
[INFO] S:     received Command: PrintText
[INFO] C: server responded with 0 command(s): []
----

Our server action performs its printing action *asynchronously*, particularly not in the UI thread!
You can see the asynchronous behavior by the line ordering in the log above.
If it were synchronous, lines 2 and 3 would never be in this order.

Note that even though all the logic runs in-memory, we have the first benefit from OpenDolphin:

WARNING: All actions are executed *asynchronously outside the UI thread*.
We cannot accidentally block it by long-running or failed operations, which is a common error in UI development.

With the first dolphinized application running, let's clean up and add a bit more OpenDolphin goodness.
