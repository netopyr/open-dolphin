we make even further use of the bindable dirty state.

First, we are binding not against the dirty state of an attribute, but against the whole
presentation model behind it. This simplifies the binding:

[source,java]
JFXBinder.bindInfo("dirty").of(textAttributeModel).to("selected").of(status);

Second, we also want the button to be enabled only when there is something reasonable to
do, i.e. when there is some value change in the form. This is a very common requirement
in business applications.

Now, JavaFX buttons do not have an "enabled" state, only a "disabled" state with the opposite
logic. Luckily, our binding facilities are perfectly able to handle this with a converter:

[source,java]
Converter converter = new Converter<Boolean,Boolean>() {
    public Boolean convert(Boolean value) {
        return !value;
    }
};
JFXBinder.bindInfo("dirty").of(textAttributeModel).using(converter).to("disabled").of(button);

You probably guessed that this code looks nicer in Groovy. Yes, it does:

[source,java]
bindInfo "dirty" of textAttributeModel using { state -> !state } to "disabled" of button


Once the code is nicely broken into independent parts we can put the various parts into separate modules
for better dependency management.
