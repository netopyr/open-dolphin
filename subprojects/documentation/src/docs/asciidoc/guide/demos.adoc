OpenDolphin has been created from use cases.

This has always been very important to us.

Each functionality in OpenDolphin is motivated by a use case that justifies it's existence in the code base.
Likewise, each use case comes with a demo in the OpenDolphin distribution - from simple, basic
attribute bindings to complex feature combinations.

This chapter leads through the various use cases from simple to increasingly complex ones.

We explain

* the use case
* OpenDolphin's approach of solving it
* how it is visible in the respective demos
