In addition of name and tag, dolphin attributes are defined also by a _qualifier_.
This property captures the fact that this attribute represents a qualified feature in the domain world.

Whenever the value of an attribute changes, instant update of all attributes that share the same qualifier will happen automatically.

Qualifiers are a prerequisite for Stable bindings

Open dolphin provides methods in client and server side to find attributes by name, and tag and by qualifier.
