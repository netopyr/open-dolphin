Presentation models can be created on the client and on the server side via the dolphin facade.

== Create a Presentation Model from the (client) view

The link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/client/ClientDolphin.html[client dolphin]
has a _presentationModel_ factory method that instantiates a link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/client/ClientPresentationModel.html[ClientPresentationModel]
and adds it to the client side link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/ModelStore.html[ModelStore]
such that all required listeners are set up and the server is notified about the construction.

*Java style*

The recommended way to create a presentation model in Java on the client side is by using the
presentationModel factory method that sets

* the unique id (if null it will be set to a generated id)
* the type (may be null if no type is required)
* a variable argument list of link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/client/ClientAttribute.html[ClientAttribute],

see also the link:./../guide/UserGuide.html#_the_purpose_of_attributes[Attribute] guide.

[source,java]
ClientPresentationModel pm = clientDolphin.presentationModel("myPmId", "myPmType", firstNameAtt, lastNameAtt);

*Groovy style*

In Groovy you can do the exact same as in Java or use one of the following shortcuts.

Generate attributes with null values from a list of attribute names.
[source,groovy]
def pm = clientDolphin.presentationModel("myPmId", ["firstName", "lastName"])

Generate attributes from named arguments or a map.
[source,groovy]
----
def pm = clientDolphin.presentationModel("myPmId", firstName:"Dierk", lastName:"Koenig")
----

[source,groovy]
----
final FIRST = "firstName"
final LAST  = "lastName"
def pm = clientDolphin.presentationModel("myPmId", (FIRST):"Dierk", (LAST):"Koenig")
----

*javascript style*
[source,javascript]
var instantUpdateAttributePM = clientDolphin.attribute("FIRST", null, "Dierk");
clientDolphin.presentationModel("myPmId", undefined, instantUpdateAttributePM);

== Create a Presentation Model from the (server) controller

On the server side, the construction of a presentation model looks very similar
but works quite differently behind the scenes. The reason is that on the server
side, presentation models are not directly constructed; instead, a command is sent to the client
requesting it to create the model.
After the client has created the presentation model, the
server is notified and the actual creation happens automatically as part of
the general synchronization process.

The link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/server/ServerDolphin.html[server dolphin]
has a _presentationModel_ convenience method that sends a
link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/comm/CreatePresentationModelCommand.html[CreatePresentationModelCommand]
to the client.

Since server-side constructions of presentation models do not instantiate
any presentation models themselves, there also are no attributes to
create the models from. Instead, we use Data Transfer Objects
(link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/server/DTO.html[DTOs])
and link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/server/Slot.html[Slots].

The _presentationModel_ convenience method needs to know the current
response (list of commands) such that it can send the
link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/comm/CreatePresentationModelCommand.html[CreatePresentationModelCommand].
Therefore, you will see the _response_ as a parameter to the
method.

When inside a link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/server/action/DolphinServerAction.html[DolphinServerAction] the
current response is known and the method call is a bit shorter.
We list both alternatives.

*Java style*

From anywhere:
[source,java]
getServerDolphin().presentationModel(response, "MyPmId", "MyType", new DTO(
    new Slot("firstName", "Dierk"),
    new Slot("lastName", "Koenig")
);


From inside a link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/org/opendolphin/core/server/action/DolphinServerAction.html[DolphinServerAction]:
[source,java]
presentationModel("MyPmId", "MyType", new DTO(
    new Slot("firstName", "Dierk"),
    new Slot("lastName", "Koenig")
));


*Groovy style or any other functional language*

You may want to create DTOs from a map.
Otherwise the calls are identical

[source,groovy]
Map data = [firstName: "Dierk", lastName:"Koenig"]
presentationModel "MyPmId", "MyType", new DTO(Slot.slots(data))

== Create client-side-only Presentation Models

OpenDolphin supports presentation models that are only created on the
client (view) and synchronized back to the server (controller).

WARNING: Client-side only presentation models remain fully functional
on the client side, i.e. binding, updates, and handling of
qualifiers is exactly the same.
They are just not visible on the server.


The typical use case is the collection of search result
presentation models, which are often not needed on the
server side.

The api is exactly the same, only the method name changes to
_clientSideModel_.

[source]
getServerDolphin().clientSideModel(response, "MyPmId", "MyType", new DTO(
    new Slot("firstName", "Dierk"),
    new Slot("lastName",  "Koenig")
);
