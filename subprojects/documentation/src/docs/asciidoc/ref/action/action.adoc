When there is the least bit of business logic, it goes into an action. Actions live in controller classes of the server module.
In server side the action will be registered and it will register the command and its command handler to apply the business logic.
In client side commands will be sent to that action.

Server dolphin interface provides a groovy-friendly convenience method to register a named action, for example

[source, groovy]
----
serverDolphin.action("saveActionName", (command, response) -> {
   //  logic
}
----

and also a java-friendly convenience method to register a named action, for example

[source, java]
----
serverDolphin.action("saveActionName", new NamedCommandHandler() {
    public void handleCommand(NamedCommand namedCommand, List<Command> commands) {
        // logic
    }
});
----

Other way of creating a named action is by the common superclass for all actions link:http://open-dolphin.org/download/api/index.html?org/opendolphin/core/server/action/DolphinServerAction.html[DolphinServerAction].
[source,java]
----
public class SaveAction extends DolphinServerAction {
    public void registerIn(ActionRegistry actionRegistry) {
        actionRegistry.register("saveActionName", new CommandHandler<Command>() {
            public void handleCommand(Command command, List<Command> response) {
                // convert model and invoke service save
            }
        });
    }
}
