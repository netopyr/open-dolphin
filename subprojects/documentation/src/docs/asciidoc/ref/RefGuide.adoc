Welcome to the OpenDolphin quick reference

The 3 most important interfaces of Open Dolphin are

* Dolphin
* PresentationModel
* Attribute

All three interfaces are defined in the dolphin-core module.
In addition to the core model, Open Dolphin provides a module for the client and the server side.
Each module contains a specialization of the interfaces.
The dolphin-client module contains the ClientDolphin, ClientPresentationModel and ClientAttribute interfaces.
