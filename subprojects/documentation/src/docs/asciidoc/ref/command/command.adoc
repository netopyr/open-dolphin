Other important feature of open dolphin are server commands.

In open dolphin commands:

* Are generic.
* Notifications from the client to the server are sent as commands.
* Instructions from the server to the client are sent as commands.
* Commands are sent asynchronously. When sending a command you can provide an _OnFinishedHandler_ that is called back
as soon as the command has returned. The list of all presentation models that were affected by that command are passed
as an argument into the callback method.
* Commands are always sent in strict sequence. We can rely on all value changes are
synchronized to the server model store before a command is processed on the server that depends on these values.

A command is registered in an action of a controller. The client can send commands to the server by an action name
when an event is triggered.

----

In a server command the presentation models can be accessed and modified.
So for example it's possible to define a save command.
Once the client triggers that command, current content of presentation model is converted into business entities and stored into the DB.

== Triggering a command from the Client

Client dolphin interface provides a java-friendly convenience method for sending a named command and
a groovy-friendly convenience method for sending a named command that expects only presentation model responses

Java example
[source,java]
----
clientDolphin.send("saveActionName", new OnFinishedHandlerAdapter() {
  @Override
  public void onFinished(List<ClientPresentationModel> presentationModels) {
     // list of all presentation models that were affected by that command is passed
     // as an argument into the callback methods.
  }
});
----

Groovy example
[source, groovy]
----
serverDolphin.action("saveActionName", (command, response) -> {
   //  logic
}
----

Web example
[source,html]
----
saveButton.onclick = function () {
   dolphin.send("saveActionName", {
       onFinished: function (models) {
          // list of all presentation models that were affected by that command is passed
          // as an argument into the callback methods.
        }
   });
};
