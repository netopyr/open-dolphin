One important feature of open dolphin is the binding. Binding is just an event listener listening to an event source.
OpenDolphin supports binding between attributes and arbitrary other objects and listens automatically
for value changes in order to notify the server.

Bind against a ClientAttribute can be done in two ways

* as a PropertyChangeListener
* through the valueProperty() method for JavaFx

Binding can be bidirectional and open dolphin keeps binding stable.
