Step 5 distributes the code into multiple modules (IntelliJ IDEA parlance) or projects/subprojects
(Gradle, Maven, Eclipse parlance). We use the more generic word "module".

The *combined* module depends on both client and server, and is used for starting the application
with the *in-memory* configuration.
The sole class that lives in this module is the starter class
[step5.TutorialStarter|https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/combined/src/main/java/step_5/TutorialStarter.java]
.
It sets up the configuration, registers the application-specific actions on the (server) controller, and starts the view.
This is the class to start from inside the IDE.

The *client* module (or "view" module if you wish) contains the
[step5.TutorialApplication|https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/client/src/main/java/step_5/TutorialApplication.java]
view.

You can see that the view code is pretty much the same as our old application code, but contains the view specific
parts only. There is one additional change, though. When the button has been pressed and the command has been
executed on the server, we would like to interpret the current content of the text field as the new base value just as
if the error-free execution of the command would imply a correct "save".
The "disabled" state of the button will reflect the new non-dirty state.

To this end, we make use of an @onFinished@ handler:
{code}
public void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
    clientDolphin.send(CMD_LOG, new OnFinishedHandlerAdapter() {
        @Override
        public void onFinished(List<ClientPresentationModel> presentationModels) {
            textAttributeModel.getAt(ATT_FIRSTNAME).rebase();
        }
    });
}
{code}

Please note that the onFinished handler will be called _asynchronously inside_ the UI thread. It may trigger
changes in the model store, which may lead to changes in the display; and any such changes _must_ occur in the
UI thread.

The *server* module (or "controller" module if you wish) contains the
[step5.TutorialAction|https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/server/src/main/java/step_5/TutorialAction.java]
controller.

Both client and server depend on the *shared* module, which makes the
[step5.TutorialConstants|https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/shared/src/main/java/step_5/TutorialConstants.java]
known to both parties. The shared module itself does not depend on anything.

The code that contains the shared constants also ensures the uniqueness of
certain Strings, particularly of IDs used to retrieve presentation models and named commands.

{code}
public static final String PM_PERSON = unique("modelId");
public static final String ATT_FIRSTNAME = "attrId";
public static final String CMD_LOG = unique("LogOnServer");

private static String unique(String key) {
    return TutorialConstants.class.getName() + "." + key;
}
{code}

Splitting four classes into four different modules may look a bit over-engineered at this point,
but it is an indispensible step before we can go on to true remoting and before we can instantly
switch between in-memory- and client-server-mode.

If you fear that it's too much work to set up the directory structure or the
build-time dependencies, simply unzip one of the
[project templates|https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/tree/master/dist]
and you are good to go.

We get the following benefits:
* ability to start the code _unmodified_ with different configurations (in-memory or client-server);
* clear and minimal dependencies when building;
* a minimum of shared code (only the constants) to express semantic dependencies as syntactic dependencies;
* actions cannot "accidentally" reach out to view code. The widget set is not even on the classpath!
* actions cannot possibly block the UI thread;
* view changes are _always_ displayed correctly since they happen in the UI thread;
* the separation of responsibilities is enforced by the dependency structure.
