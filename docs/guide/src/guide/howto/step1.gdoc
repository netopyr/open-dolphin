We stay in the "combined" module and enhance the JavaFX view
[step1.JumpStart|https://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart/blob/master/combined/src/main/java/step_1/JumpStart.java]
just slightly with a TextField and a Button that prints the content of the TextField when clicked.

The application should appear on your screen like this: \\
!../img/dolphin_pics/step1.png!

The code now contains references to the widgets
{code}
private TextField field;
private Button    button;
{code}

and an action handler

{code}
button.setOnAction(new EventHandler<ActionEvent>() {
    public void handle(ActionEvent actionEvent) {
        System.out.println("text field contains: " + field.getText());
    }
});
{code}

The printing of the field content is our "stand-in" for a real business logic.
You can easily assume some persistence action at this point or
"service" calls in general.

Now it is time to introduce OpenDolphin.
