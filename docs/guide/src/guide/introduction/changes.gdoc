h4. Release 0.11

0.11 is a maintenance release. There is no additional functionality.

The dependent version has been bumped up to 2.3.4.
The grails version for the included demos is now at 2.4.3.

Resolved Bugs:
- [DOL-121|http://www.canoo.com/jira/browse/DOL-121] - OpenDolphin should provide a default way to invalidate the session on the server side
- [DOL-123|http://www.canoo.com/jira/browse/DOL-123] - when deleting and re-creating a PM very quickly on the client side, the PM must not get lost
- [DOL-124|http://www.canoo.com/jira/browse/DOL-124] - when adding a PM to the server model store through the ServerDolphin, the client should be notified just like when using the presentationModel() factory method
- [DOL-130|http://www.canoo.com/jira/browse/DOL-130] - allow client side value changes even though the provided oldValue does not match the current value of the attribute. (JS client)

Resolved Tasks:
- [DOL-127|http://www.canoo.com/jira/browse/DOL-127] - Make all default actions use silent mode properly

h4. Release 0.10

Release 0.10 now fully supports a programming model on the server side that is equivalent to working on the client
side.
As an example: no longer do you need to call
{code}
// sending command
changeValue(attribute, value);

// to be replaced with
changeValueCommand(attribute, value);
{code}
on the server side, but you can directly use
{code}
// immediate state change
attribute.setValue(value);
{code}
which will immediately change the attribute value on the server side _and_ send the appropriate command
to the client.

This approach allows that
- any trailing code on the server side can now rely on the updated state
- any property change listeners are immediately called
- any model store listeners are immediately called

{note}
You get a full reactive *event-driven programming model* in the normally request-response oriented
Java enterprise world.
{note}

Along with this change comes full support of immediate effects on the server side for
- attribute value changes
- creating presentation models
- presentation model and attribute reset
- presentation model and attribute rebase
- presentation model and attribute switch (apply)
- instant update of all attributes that share the same qualifier
- adding attributes to presentation models
- removing single presentation models or all presentation models of a certain type
All these action now have immediate effect on the server side _and_ the appropriate commands are sent to the server.

The old approach remains fully supported even though the API will change a little (see note below).

{warning}
The old "strong" approach of never changing the server state but only sending commands to the client
had the (undocumented) effect that server actions were transactional: in case of server side exceptions
no change was sent to the client. Either all or no changes were executed.

You can still have the same behavior by restricting yourself to the old API but if you use the new API, changes will no
longer be transactional and server-side exceptions need application-specific handling.
{warning}

The old "strong" approach can easily enforce that the client is always the master. As soon as you do any
immediate server-side change there may be conflicts when client-state changes while the same state is
modified on the server.

OpenDolphin detects these conflicts and ensures that the client side always wins.

{note}
While the "old" API is fully retained in release 0.10, many methods in the @ServerDolphin@ have been deprecated.
In order to prevent confusion between old methods that merely send a command and new ones that change the server
state immediately, we will use a convention for the old methods to use a <methodname>Command suffix.
They are already available in this release and the old methods delegate to the new ones.

Please resolve the deprecation warnings as soon as possible since we will remove those methods before version 1.0.
If you have a decent IDE, you can just apply an "inline method" refactoring.
{note}

h4. Release 0.9

The biggest change in release 0.9 is the inclusion of *OpenDolphin.js*, the JavaScript client (DOL-98) that allows to share
the same OpenDolphin application on desktop and web (including mobile web).\\
See also [OpenDolphin for the web|guide:web]

The [push|guide:demo_push] capability ([DOL-30|http://www.canoo.com/jira/browse/DOL-30C]) has been moved from the demos into the OpenDolphin core and is now an official feature
with a simple API, standard behaviour, and - as always - the option the replace the default implementation with
your preferred technology.

Both OpenDolphin.js and the push capability in combination with the existing OpenDolphin features allow for
new interesting use cases that are show-cased in this release:
- [multi-device|guide:demo_multi_device] applications where the same application runs on many devices
- [re-connect|guide:demo_follow_me] to an application exactly where you left off even after a longer *offline* period
- [follow-me|guide:demo_follow_me] applications where you start your work on one device - let's says on the road with a smartphone or a tablet - and complete your work in the office with a desktop application for longer text entries
- [team-applications|guide:demo_team_app] where a whole team works collaboratively and everybody immediately sees all contributions from all other team members, avoiding double-work and conflicts, and mutually completing, correcting, and helping with each other's work
- [point-of-sale|guide:demo_point_of_sale] solutions where personnel shares a limited set of workstations, freely moving between them and always having their latest context available
- application [integration|guide:demo_integration] where you combine the strength of different view technologies, say JavaFX for the layout and web technology for charting, into an integrated OpenDolphin application.

Tags are no longer enums but instances of the Tag class (DOL-95) to allow *custom tags*.
All existing tags are available as constants of that class except the MESSAGE tag, which is replaced by custom tags.

Attributes now maintain a direct reference to their PresentationModel. This allows an *efficient lookup*
of tags for a given Attribute (DOL-97). Sharing an Attribute instance between PresentationModels is no longer supported.
In order to share the same information across PresentationModels, use Attributes with the same qualifier.

Furthermore, a number of *performance enhancements* and *consistency checks* have been included.

Please find the full list of changes [here|http://www.canoo.com/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=11400&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=10480&amp;Create=Create].

h4. Release 0.8

25 issues have been addressed in this release where the most important ones come from our
users that already have OpenDolphin-based applications in production.
This ranges from performance-oriented topics like the support for client-side models,
command batching and compressing down to operational support to e.g. detect
unwanted breaches of the session affinity.

The full list of closed issues is at [the project JIRA|http://www.canoo.com/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=11263&amp;styleName=Html&amp;projectId=10480&amp;Create=Create]

h4. Release 0.7

There are no changes in this release. It has only been built to set the
maven group id to @org.open-dolphin@ to comply with the conventions on maven central.

The project artefacts are now available for download from
[MavenCentral|http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Corg.open-dolphin]

Please refer to [DolphinJumpStart|http://github.com/canoo/DolphinJumpStart] for an example on how to use OpenDolphin
with either Maven or Gradle.

h4. Release 0.6 : Notable Changes since 0.5

The 0.6 release has only one change, which is a rather big and breaking one:

{note}
The package com.canoo.dolphin has been renamed to org.opendolphin.
{note}

See also [DOL-34|http://www.canoo.com/jira/browse/DOL-34]

h4. Release 0.5 : Notable Changes since 0.4

The project artefacts are now available for download from
[MavenCentral|http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Ccom.canoo.dolphin]

Release 0.5 introduced support for asynchronous server-side events, which are distributed
through an event bus. Typical use cases for this event bus are:
- instant visualization of server side events (think JMS or hibernate events)
- consistent visualization of transient data across many clients
- cross-client notifications

Along with this capability comes a series of demos, which live directly in the OpenDolphin
code base. Some of these demos also have a video presentation on [YouTube|http://youtube.com/users/dierkkoenig]:
- [ManyEventsDemo|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bMKcpM4znJI] where 10'000 alarm events happen on the server and 6 clients update instantly and consistently
- [TrainControlDemo|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T4lrmafN39k] where a dash board changes the train speed and other clients are notified
- [LazyLoadingDemo|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MDWAjOBCgRU] with 100'000 rows in a table
- [PortfolioDemo|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=W-LCvTa5MQQ] where the management of a portfolio serves as a typical example of a business application

Version 0.5 upgraded dependencies to Groovy 2.1.1. and GPars 1.0. We make use of the new
@CompileStatic where appropriate and enhanced execution speed by 60%.

[Release Notes - Dolphin - Version 0.4 |http://www.canoo.com/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?version=11265&amp;styleName=Text&amp;projectId=10480&amp;Create=Create]

h5. Breaking Changes
The "linking" feature is no longer available. See e.g. the Crud demo for alternatives.

h5. Deprecations
In the future, we will disallow direct access to the connector or model store.

Please prepare by using the dolphin (@ClientDolphin@ and @ServerDolphin@) facade whenever possible.
This also true for all the cases where application code on the server side directly invokes constructors of
commands, presentation models or attributes. Please use factory methods instead.

h5. Solved Bugs
# DOL-15 - Basic build fails
# DOL-22 - exception in reference table demo and search demo
# DOL-26 - Binding the text property of a Swing component to a ClientPresentationModel throws Exception
# DOL-31 - ServerDolphin.createPresentationModel has an "optional" parameter, which is required
# DOL-35 - com.canoo.dolphin.demo.startCreatePresentationModelDemo.groovy still tries to invoke serverDolphin.createPresentationModel
